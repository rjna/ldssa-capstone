# Transformers overview

NumericalDataCleaning -> does the cleaning of the numerical data. In this case, it replaces some of the ageâ€™s values by the median (I assumed that any driver under 12 years old would be a data imputation problem) and drops the ResidentIndicator column.  
CategoricalDataCleaning -> does the cleaning of the categorical data. In this case, it fills nulls with some reasonable values, drops some columns and replaces some department names that were incorrect.  
CreateCyclicalFeatures -> creates time related features from the timestamp feature.  
Test -> does some printing just for debugging purposes.

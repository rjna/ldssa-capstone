25_January_Final -> This json file is basically a dump from the heroku postgreSQL database.  
25_January_Results -> This jupyter notebook contains the calculation of the performance metrics of the machine learning pipeline, after the production run.  
Report 2 -> This pdf file contains the second report of the capstone.  

The dry_run_to_23_January folder contains some partial analysis of the performance metrics during the production run. These results are also included in the second report to justify why the model was not redeployed during the production run.
